    <h1>Queen (Band)</h1>
    <div class='content'>
      Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic
      line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar,
      vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their
      earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy
      metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and
      radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock
      and pop rock. Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in
      the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to
      experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined
      in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February
      1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen
      first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer
      Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them
      international success. The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which
      stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the
      music video format. The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We
      Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", which have become anthems at
      sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium
      rock bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" from The Game (1980)
      became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album
      Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified nine
      times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert
      is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In
      August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth,
      England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumoniaâ€”a complication of AIDS.
      Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the
      "Queen +" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert. Queen have
      been a global presence in popular culture for more than four decades.
      Estimates of their record sales range from 170 million to 300 million,
      making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen
      received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.
      They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and with
      each member having composed hit singles all four were inducted into the
      Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005 they received the Ivor Novello
      Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of
      Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 they were presented the
      Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
